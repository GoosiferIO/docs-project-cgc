# Project CGC Documentation

This website was set up for any new developers who are interested in contributing to the project. The website is built using [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/), a static site generator that's geared towards project documentation. The website is hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), and the source code can be found [here](https://github.com/ProjectCGC/docs-project-cgc).

At the moment, the documentation is targeted towards programmers rather than design but other disciplines are welcome to contribute and add their own pages.
